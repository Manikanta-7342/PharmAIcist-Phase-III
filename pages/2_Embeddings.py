                * Extracted molecular function keywords using [UniProt API Calls](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic_access) for each protein. **Left with 11222 Proteins**
                * Extracted protein sequence descriptors using [Protr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/protr/vignettes/protr.html) R library
                * Extracted protein sequence embeddings from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/help/embeddings) for each protein
                * Extracted amino acids descriptors from protein sequences using [Peptides](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Peptides/versions/2.4.4) R library (Converted to numpy arrays)
